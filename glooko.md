## Investigating the impact of clinician's behavior patients diabetes management

As part of my Master of Engineering program at UC Berkeley, I was working on a industry based Capstone project with three of my colleagues. The following abstract and poster summarizes our work in collaboration with [Glooko](https://www.glooko.com).

#### Summary
Blood glucose management for an individual is far from a perfect system. The
unexpectedness of the world a person with diabetes lives in causes unpredictability
in blood glucose levels. The huge market for digital diabetes management makes it
an exciting research sector. Using massive datasets obtained from the web based
application provided by Glooko, our industry partner, we evaluated the correlation
between how a doctor and a person with diabetes interact with one company’s
platform in the hopes to better advise doctors in treatment of diabetes. Although we
could not validate the existence of this correlation, we believe there’s a huge
potential for the future work on this dataset.
