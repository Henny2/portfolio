## Makeover Monday's
I got introduced to Makeover Monday in my Data Viz class at UC Berkeley. Under the hashtag #makeovermonday, people from all over the world redesign one particular visualization every week. This visualization is picked by Eva Murray and Andy Kriebel, two data viz gurus, with the intention to create a learning, better visualizations and an exchange about best practices.

I participated for the first time in week 8 of this year and really enjoyed being part of the Makeover Monday community and working on a specific dataset along professionals and data viz beginners like me.  
My goal is to participate in more #makeovermondays to improve my design and tableau skills.
