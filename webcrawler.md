# Webcrawling Projects

Last fall, as we had to choose projects for a Machine Learning project, I would have loved to be as experienced with Web Crawling as I am now. At some point I made my first steps with Beautifulsoup but never actually crawled a complete data set. It was last March when my team and I had to crawl hotel and restaurant reviews from tripadvisor for another school project. I saw that as my chance to get some web crawling experience.

Since then I have been pretty confident in crawling the web for data on static websites and was able to scrape data that would have helped realize some ideas my team partner and I had for our [data viz project](startupFunding) along the way. 

Two days after my official graduation, a friend reached out to me with a problem. He wanted to extract contact information for over 1000 clients that was shown on click, in a pop-up window. To do that manually, it would have meant a lot of tidious work, thus he was reaching out looking for a solution. For me, it meant to write my first web crawler for a password protected website. Furthermore, it was the first time I was working with the [ASP.NET framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET){:target="_blank"}.

However, I was up for the challenge and excited to help a friend with my coding skills. After 6-7 hours of figuring things out and learning how to crawl web pages that are rendered dynamically, my friend had the desired excel list with names and contact information for over 1000 clients.
