## Workout Wednesday
Through the amazing dataviz community on Twitter I just recently got introduced to [Workout Wednesday](http://www.workout-wednesday.com). In case you donâ€™t know me, I never skip a (CrossFit) workout, thus I was curious to participate in Workout Wednesday as well. 

Workout Wednesday is a weekly Tableau challenge where you have to recreate a dashboard that fits certain requirements. I already learned so many new Tableau hacks taking part in the first two weeks that I committed to continue. Take a look at the recreated dashboards below.
